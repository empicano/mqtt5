# mqtt5

A sans-I/O implementation of the MQTTv5 protocol for Python written in Rust. Serialization is ~5x faster and deserialization ~20x faster than comparable Python code (benchmarked against [mqttproto](https://github.com/agronholm/mqttproto)).

**Write a packet**

```py
import mqtt5

buffer = bytearray(1024)
n = mqtt5.ConnectPacket(client_id="Bulbasaur").write(buffer)
```

**Read a packet**

```py
import mqtt5

buffer = bytearray(b"\x20\x03\x00\x00\x00")
packet, n = mqtt5.read(buffer)
```

mqtt5 enforces the MQTTv5 specification. Invalid packets will raise exceptions rather than being silently ignored or partially parsed. Note that this library only implements the low-level packet de/serialization.

## Installation

```console
$ pip install mqtt5
```

## Acknowledgments

mqtt5 was inspired by Brett Cannon's [sans-I/O documentation](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io). I've also learned a lot from Alex Gr√∂nholm's [mqttproto](https://github.com/agronholm/mqttproto), which is an excellent pure-Python MQTTv5 protocol implementation.
